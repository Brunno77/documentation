Title: Enable Event Monitor  

# Enable Event Monitor  

Event Monitor - EVM - is a module that aims to be an intermediary between CITSmart ESP and client solutions (eg. Nagios, CITSmart Inventoty), serving as a repository of event information, generated by monitoring tools or inventory process.

To enable it in a CITSmart ESP instance it is necessary to download the WAR package and perform deploy on the Wildfly application server, which can be the same as the CITSmart ESP. It is important to note that EVM should be available on a port other than the ESP application. In addition, we note that EVM does not have its own interface because management is done via the ESP application.  

## Procedure  

1. Download the war package from the EVM component;  
2. Unpack the files;  
3. Copy the package to the deployment folder of the Wildfly application server;  
4. Configure [System Properties][2] with Mongo access data and the CITSmart ESP instance;  

## What to do next  

To test the EVM, [configure][1] the connections in the CITSmart ESP instance.
