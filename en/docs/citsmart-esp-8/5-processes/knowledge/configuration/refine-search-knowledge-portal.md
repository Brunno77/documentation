#Refine search in Knowledge Portal
This knowledge aims to guide and suggest the best ways of search in the Knowledge Portal and in the User Guide.

1.  Connectors between terms (Boolean logical operator):

    -AND (+): it's possible to search with more than one word, prioritizing one
    of them in the result. Adding the positive sign "+" in front of the word,
    it'll be prioritized, for example: ticket +delegate;

    -NOT (-): it's possible to refine (reduce) the result, including words to be
    excluded of the list. E.g.: Request -Incident.

1.  Vary how to write a word, for example:

    -Request

    -Requesting

    -It's possible to search for a part of the word: Reque

1.  Use synonyms:

    -Generate

    -Create

1.  Search for the exactly phrase:

    -Put the phrase you want with commas, e.g.: "How to delegate a ticket"

1.  Navigate through the folders and click in one with the subject you want.
