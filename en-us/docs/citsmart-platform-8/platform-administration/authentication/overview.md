Title: Overview

# Overview

Natively, three types of authentication are possible on the platform: local, LDAP/AD, and SSO.

- **Local:**
This is the standard method of accessing the platform, where users are registered in the tool database.

- **LDAP/AD:**
The authentication is the most common form of access to the platform and is geared towards the end customer scenario. It allows you to authenticate to the system without the need to create users manually.

- **Sing Single On - SSO:**
This is an alternative to automatic login on the platform. However, it's necessary to have an infrastructure oriented to this service.
