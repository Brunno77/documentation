Stages for deployment
------------------------

For greater effectiveness, FDM steps were developed organized
and based on fundamental management:

-   **Organizational Change**

People are the main pillar of any institution and changes can often be uncomfortable
for most, therefore, it is important to map the key users of the new system and engage 
them to become internal disseminators of new solution.

-   **Communication**

It is important that communication happens in the right time and is directed to the
right people, so bottlenecks, risks and any other negative impact factor can be 
treated and mitigated proactively.

-   **Deployment Project**
 For project management we use and are inspired by the agile and project
 management methodologies already consolidated in the market.
 
 FDM Structure
 ---------------
 
 FDM is organized to work on a flexible model where different teams can
 execute their work using various management structures and standards 
 while maintaining synchronization with the client's objectives.
