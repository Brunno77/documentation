Title: Implement Event Monitor

# Implement Event Monitor  

Event Monitor - EVM - is a module that aims to be an intermediary between CITSmart Platform and client solutions (eg. Nagios, CITSmart Inventoty), serving as a repository of event information, generated by monitoring tools or inventory process.

To enable it in a CITSmart Platform instance it is necessary to download the WAR package and perform deploy on the Wildfly application server, which can be the same as the CITSmart Platform. It is important to note that EVM should be available on a port other than the CITSmart Platform application. In addition, we note that EVM does not have its own interface because management is done via the CITSmart Platform application.  

## Procedure  

1. Download the war package from the EVM component;  
2. Unpack the files;  
3. Copy the package to the deployment folder of the Wildfly application server;  
4. Configure [System Properties][2] with Mongo access data and the CITSmart Platform instance;  

## What to do next  

To test the EVM, [configure][1] the connections in the CITSmart Platform instance.
