![Problem Detail](images/df5b817ae22b8cbec1532249518fa06a.png)

It's now possible to link and view, on one screen, the list of incidents that generated the problem **(a.)**. The problem registration started to use the concept of portfolio of templates **(b.)**. Templates are pre-registered with the attendance flow, responsible group, status and others, making the creation, classification and attendance of problems more practical **(c.)**.

![a-Problem incidents](images/4977321406008c911b7444314ac0adfd.png)
