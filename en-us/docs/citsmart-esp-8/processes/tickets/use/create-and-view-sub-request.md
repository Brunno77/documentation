#Create and view sub-request
It's possible to create sub-requests through the main request and view them after created.

Before getting started
--------------------------

It's necessary to previously register the ticket, employee and unit, in addition
to have permission to register the ticket.

##Procedure


1.  Access the main menu Processes
    \> Request and Incident Management \> Service Request and Incident;

2.  To create the sub-request:

    -   Click on the ticket you want and select "Create sub-request" in the
        options menu;

    -   Complete all necessary field and click on "Save".

3.  To view the sub-request:

    -   Click on the ticket you want and select "View sub-request" in the
        options menu.
        
!!! Abstract "NOTE"
    
    The sub-request has its own flow, therefore, it's not finished along with the
    closure of the origin ticket. It should, then, be executed and closed autonomously.
    
!!! Abstract "NOTE"
    
    The sub-request can be reopened at any time, regardless of the status of the parent 
    request (whether it's reopened or closed).
