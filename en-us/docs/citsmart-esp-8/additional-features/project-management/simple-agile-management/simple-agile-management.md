Title: Gerenciamento ágil Simple

# Simple Agile Management


Simple is a functionality of the CITSmart Platform that allows the easy and agile
management of activities. It was created to manage projects in the simplest way,
with resources to organize, monitor and delegate the activities among the members
of your team or individually.

Simple is based on the Kanban methodology, it's visually organized in a framework
with cards that indicate the flow progress.

In the Simple workspace, activities are inserted and grouped by projects
(in Simple called Workspace), task pane (in Simple called Sprint) and finally
tasks, which can be in groups of cards.

3.  Each Workspace will have in its home screen a summary of Sprints and
    its deadlines:

    -   Expired: it presents the number of **Sprints** with the "delivery date"
    smaller than the current date/time;

    -   To be expired: it presents the numer of **Sprints** with the "delivery date"
    that will expire in 24hs from the current date/time;

    -   On time: it presents the number of **Sprints** with the "delivery date"
    bigger than 24hs from the current date/time;

    -   Total: sum of the **Sprints** inside the Workspace.


*II - Create a Sprint*

2.  Click on “Sprint”, give it a title and "Save”;

3.  Each Sprint has in its home screen a counter of **tasks**, hours spent
    and planned, total of tasks by deadline established and its percentage of
    achievement:

    -   Expired: it presents the number of **tasks** with the "delivery date" smaller
    than the current date/time;

    -   To be expired: it presents the number of **tasks** with the "Delivery date"
    that will expire in 24hs from the current date/time;

    -   On time: it presents the number of **tasks** with the "delivery date" bigger
    than 24hs from the current date/time;

    -   Total: it presents the total number of **tasks** of the Sprint;

    -   The progress bar has the following calculation:

        -   1st It's made the sum of the tasks estimate of all completed **tasks**;

        -   2nd The sum of the total estimates of all **tasks** is summed;

        -   3rd Progress is the percentage calculated with the total estimates of 
            completed **tasks** on the total estimates of all tasks.
