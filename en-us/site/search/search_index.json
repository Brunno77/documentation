Both a Request and an Incident can be categorized in the register of activities in a service , categories can be created on the same registration screen, at the time of category linking, or on specific features for Create service category . Is it possible to attach documents to incidents, requests, problems and changes? Both the Reques and Incident may have documents attatched in their opening and attendance, for Problems and Changes documents may be attached to each phase of the solution and also, if necessary, in each of the stages defined in the solution of the problem or change. Documents can be of any type (extension) and their maximum size can be set by the administrator in system parameter 278 (default is 1GB). How to access the service request from the email notification? To access the service request from the email notification, follow the guidelines below: Make sure you are logged in to the system; Open the service request email notification; The notification will have the request number with a hyperlink, just click on the number, which will then be redirected to the Service Management screen, presenting the request information. What is the impact of the \"Solver Group\" filter on the behavior of requests and incidents searches? When the \"solver group\" filter is active, only closed ones will be shown, since when selecting this filter, it is understood that there is a need to present the group that actually solved a request, not presenting groups responsible for tasks (according to The flow bound to the request service) executed after the request is resolved. Let's look at a generic example: For example, service A has a linked quality flow, after solving a service A request and advancing the flow, the responsible group will be the quality group and this will terminate the life cycle of the request in question, but this group is not The group that solved this request, it only approved the solution and terminated the request, so it will not appear in the report generated by the Inquiries and Incidents search screen when the \"Solver Group\" filter is marked with a specific group. However, when the \"Solver Group\" filter is not active, the group presented in the report or search will be the group referring to the current request task, ie if the request is closed and has a quality flow, the group will be presented Of quality as the current group responsible for closing the life cycle of this request, if the request is in progress, will be presented the current group responsible for the execution of this request. Why will service request numbering not always follow a strict/perfect sequential order on the service request screen or in some reports? Both the Service Request screen and some reports (such as \"Quality of Service - SLA\"), the ordering of the number of requests follows an increasing sequential order, except when: 1- The reports group the data by some special criteria (eg, by SLA, which is what happens in the case of the report \"Quality of Service - SLA\"); 2- When the feature called Sequence Block is impacted by an external factor, this occurs if: - There is an application stop for version upgrade, or environment maintenance and later return; - The environment is clustered. Configuration How to configure the service request notification e-mails? When registering a service request, perform determined activities and its execution, the petitioner will be notified. In order for the notification be sent it is necessary to perform the following procedures: 1- Access the Contract Services related to the business service Portfolio Management > Services Portfolio > Business Service > Contract > Services and technical service Portfolio Management > Service Portfolio > Business Service > Support/Technical Service > Contract > Services e and insert the e-mail template in the fields: 'Incident/Request Opening E-mail Template' 'Incident/Requistion Execution E-mail Template' 'Incident/Request Ongoing Activities E-mail Template' RULE: If e-mail templates are not inserted, the notification will not be sent. 2- Access the Group Register feature General Registration > Staff Management > Group; 3- The Group Register screen will be displayed. If the group has already been registered in the system, search for it; 4- Select it; 5- The intended group entry screen will be displayed, determine if the e-mail notifications (opening, in progress and execution) related to the requests will be mandatory; RULE: if it is determined that notifications will be mandatory, when registering a service request, on the Incident/Request Service entry screen, these options will be selected already, not allowing any changes. But if it has been determined that notifications will not be mandatory, when registering a service request, these options will be available to be determined by the petitioner. 6- On the Incident/Request Service Request screen, when registering a service request the rules related to the e-mail notifications will be established, determined in the group entry. RULE: when registering a service request, the notification will only be sent to the performer group, which is responsible for attending to the request. When the activities are in progress and then finished, the notifications will only be sent to the requester. How to enable the service requests escalation rule? The service request scheduling rule is enabled on the CITSmart Parameter screen. To enable this rule, proceed as follows: 1- In the citsmart.cfg file put the routine START_MONITORA_INCIDENTES=TRUE; 2- Access the CITSmart Parameters feature by navigating in the main menu System > CITSmart Parameters; 3- The CITSmart Parameters screen will appear, click the CITSmart Parameters Search tab; 4- Search and change the parameter 190 - Turns on the operation of the scheduling rules (Eg: Y or N - Default: 'N') informing the value \"Y\" to activate service request scheduling; 5- Search and change the parameter 31 - Sends e-mail in the execution of request/incident flows (Eg: Y or N), informing the value \"Y\"; 6- Search and change the parameter 297 - Disable sending system e-mails (Values:\" Y \"or\" N \"Default:\" N \") informing the value \"N\"; 7- Also make the necessary changes in the following parameters, according to the need and scenario of the installation: 195 - E-mail template id for sending deadline request notification (Eg: 1) 197 - User login that will receive e-mail regarding service request scheduling rules that are expiring (eg Consultant) 113 - E-mail Template ID for Auto Escalation 10 - SMTP SEND - E-mail origin of service request notifications 33 - System access URL 8- Click the \"Save\" button to perform the operation, in which case the date, time and user will be automatically stored for a future audit. How do I set a default group for the first level service request? To set the default group for 1 st level attendance, proceed as follows: Access the Group Registration feature by navigating in the main menu Access and Permission > Group. The group registration screen will be displayed, displaying the contracts; Make the registration of the group of 1 st level, if not registered, and proceed with the completion of the fields; If the 1 st level group is already registered in the system, carry out the group search and obtain their identification number (ID); After obtaining the 1 st level group ID, access the CITSmart Parameters feature by navigating through the main menu. Parameterization > Parameters CITSmart; The CITSmart Parameters screen appears, click the CITSmart Parameters Search tab; Perform the search for parameter \"9 - Group ID Level 1\"; Select the same; The parameter registration screen with the contents of the selected record will be displayed, in the value field, enter the identification number (ID) of the 1 st level group; Click the \"Record\" button to perform the operation, in which case the date, time and user will be automatically stored for a future audit. RULE: after setting the parameter, when registering a Service Request/Incident, if you have not informed the group to service the service, the group will be scaled, which was defined in the parameter For 1 st level service. Why does the system display an invalid date message when auditing the ticket? In the Ticket Management interface, specifically in the \"Audit\" item, when trying to configure the auditing of an open ticket (set start and end dates in the filter), the following error may occur: the system will display the message \"Invalid Date\". This is because the functionality requires that the language set in the system and browser used be the same. If this requirement is not observed and this difference occurs in the languages, when auditing the tickets, the system will display a message and make it impossible to obtain the desired report. It's therefore necessary to match the system and browser languages. Portfolio and Catalog Management \u00b6 Usage How to link staff members (users) to a group?

Internal: only people with permission in the knowledge folder can view. Is it possible to version knowledge in the knowledge management? To version a knowledge, open one in the knowledge management interface, click on \"Edit\" in the knowledge information screen and then on \"Version\". It's also possible to \"Archive the previous version\" of the knowledge. Configuration How are documents ranked at the time of SOLR knowledge base search? To rank the documents at the time of the search, Solr generates a score for each document. Thus, the document that has the highest score, is presented first and the others, with lower scores, in sequence. To calculate the document score Solr uses a standard algorithm, where the frequency of the searched term is checked. But, it is possible to change the punctuation with the use of the boosts. Solr's boosters can be used in two moments at the time of indexing or query, and their use in search is more common. Some boosters that may change the calculation of the score at the time of the survey are: term^num: where \"num\" is the importance of the search term, example: incident^2; And the field boosters and dismax and edismax functions can also be used to boost search. At ITSM, no booster is used, so far, only Solr's standard score calculation is used, and at the end of the search the ranking is done by the score and by the number of times the knowledge was voted / liked. Boosters are open for use, but to use them requires a better analysis of the importance of fields and documents added to Solr, by the knowledge base. How to setup the SOLR feature? PARAMETER CONFIGURATION To configure a parameter navigate to the screen \u201cParametrization > Knowledge Management\u201d; Search for the parameter \u201cSOLR URL server (i.e.: http://localhost:8983/solr/collection_name )\u201d; After inserting the SOLR server URL, a URL example would be the following: http://localhost:8983/solr/base_conhecimento .

System performance is defined as the time the software takes to perform a given task, since this performance is a strong quality attribute perceived by software users. There is the capability of the system to work with more than one instance. For this, it is necessary to use the configuration file (citsmart.cfg), where you can activate or inactivate routines. To use this capability, the citsmart.cfg file must exist in the directory: \\j boss \\s tandalone \\c onfiguration \\ ( When Jboss rises as a single instance ) \\j boss \\d omain \\c onfiguration \\ ( When using cluster, has domains and hosts ) Here are the guidelines you need to complete the configuration: RULE: where $ {value} is replaced by the corresponding values. 1- START_MODE_RULES = $ {value} (This parameter defines whether to process scheduling rules. Enter the value TRUE to activate or FALSE to disable); 2- START_MODE_ITSM = $ {value} (This parameter defines whether to display the ITSM interface.) Enter the value TRUE or FALSE, if it is set to FALSE, it will not allow you to open the ITSM (Incident, etc.) functionality; 3- START_MONITORING_ASSETS = $ {value} (This parameter sets whether asset tracking is enabled. Enter the value TRUE to activate or FALSE to disable); 4- QUANTITY_BACKUPLOGDADOS = $ {value} (This parameter defines the number of items in the table that are to be backed up. Enter the number of items, eg 1000); 5- The parameters below when not enabled causes the system to go up with threads disabled to improve system performance. It is necessary to configure these parameters before starting Jboss for their operation; 6- START_MONITORA_INCIDENTES = $ {value} (This parameter sets whether to disable incident tracking. Enter the value TRUE on or FALSE on); 7- START_VERIFY_EVENTS = $ {value} (This parameter sets whether to disable event checking. Enter the value TRUE on or FALSE on); 8- Use of the parameters below is optional. They separate the main connection pool with the flow, inventory, and report execution pool; JDBC_ALIAS_BPM = java: / jdbc / $ {value} (This parameter defines the name of the datasource of the stream.

Scripts available for: Oracle SQL Postgre SQL SQL Server Download Scripts What permissions are necessary on the destination folder of the Logdata table backup? The permissions on the folder must be read and write to the user that JBoss uses. When does data synchronization occur with LDAP? The system synchronizes the credential data of its users with LDAP in three different situations: On application activation, usually in sequence to the product version update procedure; When the user logs in (access to the system with its login and password), then the system automatically checks the user's authentication and permission; In the LDAP Configuration menu option, when the user clicks its 'Synchronize' link. When is removed the data from the Logdata table? The backup routine of the LogData table removes the data from the table and saves it to a file, that is, the table becomes clean after processing. Why are the schedules created by the tool different from the current time? SCENARIO When creating a ticket, the time is different from the actual time, alternating between 1 (one) and 3 (three) hours of delay or advance. WHAT TO CHECK Postgresql database configuration file: Postgresql.conf - timezone = 'BRAZIL/EAST' On the container cloud: Setting timezone on the operating system. Setting up the TimeZone on the JRE: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/troubleshoot/time-zone-settings-jre.htm#JSTGD362 Why in some reports does the same request appear more than once? In some reports such as \"Report Incidents / Service Requests - Detailed\", both in pdf format and in xls format, the same request may exist more than once, however they are distinct details because it deals with each step of the request, so each time it \"repeats\" is because it changes the task, or the responsible, or the phase, or the situation, or the group solver or the final hour of service. In other reports, such as the \"Report Incidents / Service Requests\", there is no detail of the request according to the activities and therefore the request is not shown more than once. Why is the result 'Empty Report' when generating the reportQuantitativeControlPercentual when selecting in the filter the situation 'in progress' and the 'solver group'? This is not an error, the solver group field is populated only when the request is terminated, this causes to only brings results to situations such as \"Closed\", incompatible with what is being requested / reported in the filters. Will the backup be overwritten or will there be a file for every day? If your routine has a daily backup, a file will be created every day, containing the name and date of the file. Why does my instance with DBMS SQL Server is slow on the ticket listing screen? In the standalone.xml file you must add the following configuration to the SQL Server database access URL: ;sendStringParametersAsUnicode=false Example: jdbc: sqlserver : //server:port;databaseName=myDataBase;sendStringParametersAsUnicode=false Enter the configuration of all dataSources. How can the expiration time of the application sessions be changed? This type of change is configured in the functionality Parametrization > CITSmart Parameters. Then, select the parameter 449 and add the value you want in minutes. After that, you need to disconnect and reconnect to the system, so the system will look for the new default for session expiration time.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq.html#frequently-asked-questions-faq","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ"},{"location":"faq.html#processes","text":"","title":"Processes"},{"location":"faq.html#ticket-management","text":"Usage Is it possible to categorize the Request/Incident (Ticket)? Both a Request and an Incident can be categorized in the register of activities in a service , categories can be created on the same registration screen, at the time of category linking, or on specific features for Create service category . Is it possible to attach documents to incidents, requests, problems and changes? Both the Reques and Incident may have documents attatched in their opening and attendance, for Problems and Changes documents may be attached to each phase of the solution and also, if necessary, in each of the stages defined in the solution of the problem or change. Documents can be of any type (extension) and their maximum size can be set by the administrator in system parameter 278 (default is 1GB). How to access the service request from the email notification? To access the service request from the email notification, follow the guidelines below: Make sure you are logged in to the system; Open the service request email notification; The notification will have the request number with a hyperlink, just click on the number, which will then be redirected to the Service Management screen, presenting the request information. What is the impact of the \"Solver Group\" filter on the behavior of requests and incidents searches? When the \"solver group\" filter is active, only closed ones will be shown, since when selecting this filter, it is understood that there is a need to present the group that actually solved a request, not presenting groups responsible for tasks (according to The flow bound to the request service) executed after the request is resolved. Let's look at a generic example: For example, service A has a linked quality flow, after solving a service A request and advancing the flow, the responsible group will be the quality group and this will terminate the life cycle of the request in question, but this group is not The group that solved this request, it only approved the solution and terminated the request, so it will not appear in the report generated by the Inquiries and Incidents search screen when the \"Solver Group\" filter is marked with a specific group. However, when the \"Solver Group\" filter is not active, the group presented in the report or search will be the group referring to the current request task, ie if the request is closed and has a quality flow, the group will be presented Of quality as the current group responsible for closing the life cycle of this request, if the request is in progress, will be presented the current group responsible for the execution of this request. Why will service request numbering not always follow a strict/perfect sequential order on the service request screen or in some reports? Both the Service Request screen and some reports (such as \"Quality of Service - SLA\"), the ordering of the number of requests follows an increasing sequential order, except when: 1- The reports group the data by some special criteria (eg, by SLA, which is what happens in the case of the report \"Quality of Service - SLA\"); 2- When the feature called Sequence Block is impacted by an external factor, this occurs if: - There is an application stop for version upgrade, or environment maintenance and later return; - The environment is clustered. Configuration How to configure the service request notification e-mails? When registering a service request, perform determined activities and its execution, the petitioner will be notified. In order for the notification be sent it is necessary to perform the following procedures: 1- Access the Contract Services related to the business service Portfolio Management > Services Portfolio > Business Service > Contract > Services and technical service Portfolio Management > Service Portfolio > Business Service > Support/Technical Service > Contract > Services e and insert the e-mail template in the fields: 'Incident/Request Opening E-mail Template' 'Incident/Requistion Execution E-mail Template' 'Incident/Request Ongoing Activities E-mail Template' RULE: If e-mail templates are not inserted, the notification will not be sent. 2- Access the Group Register feature General Registration > Staff Management > Group; 3- The Group Register screen will be displayed. If the group has already been registered in the system, search for it; 4- Select it; 5- The intended group entry screen will be displayed, determine if the e-mail notifications (opening, in progress and execution) related to the requests will be mandatory; RULE: if it is determined that notifications will be mandatory, when registering a service request, on the Incident/Request Service entry screen, these options will be selected already, not allowing any changes. But if it has been determined that notifications will not be mandatory, when registering a service request, these options will be available to be determined by the petitioner. 6- On the Incident/Request Service Request screen, when registering a service request the rules related to the e-mail notifications will be established, determined in the group entry. RULE: when registering a service request, the notification will only be sent to the performer group, which is responsible for attending to the request. When the activities are in progress and then finished, the notifications will only be sent to the requester. How to enable the service requests escalation rule? The service request scheduling rule is enabled on the CITSmart Parameter screen. To enable this rule, proceed as follows: 1- In the citsmart.cfg file put the routine START_MONITORA_INCIDENTES=TRUE; 2- Access the CITSmart Parameters feature by navigating in the main menu System > CITSmart Parameters; 3- The CITSmart Parameters screen will appear, click the CITSmart Parameters Search tab; 4- Search and change the parameter 190 - Turns on the operation of the scheduling rules (Eg: Y or N - Default: 'N') informing the value \"Y\" to activate service request scheduling; 5- Search and change the parameter 31 - Sends e-mail in the execution of request/incident flows (Eg: Y or N), informing the value \"Y\"; 6- Search and change the parameter 297 - Disable sending system e-mails (Values:\" Y \"or\" N \"Default:\" N \") informing the value \"N\"; 7- Also make the necessary changes in the following parameters, according to the need and scenario of the installation: 195 - E-mail template id for sending deadline request notification (Eg: 1) 197 - User login that will receive e-mail regarding service request scheduling rules that are expiring (eg Consultant) 113 - E-mail Template ID for Auto Escalation 10 - SMTP SEND - E-mail origin of service request notifications 33 - System access URL 8- Click the \"Save\" button to perform the operation, in which case the date, time and user will be automatically stored for a future audit.

RULE: after setting the parameter, when registering a Service Request/Incident, if you have not informed the group to service the service, the group will be scaled, which was defined in the parameter For 1 st level service. Why does the system display an invalid date message when auditing the ticket? In the Ticket Management interface, specifically in the \"Audit\" item, when trying to configure the auditing of an open ticket (set start and end dates in the filter), the following error may occur: the system will display the message \"Invalid Date\". This is because the functionality requires that the language set in the system and browser used be the same. If this requirement is not observed and this difference occurs in the languages, when auditing the tickets, the system will display a message and make it impossible to obtain the desired report. It's therefore necessary to match the system and browser languages.","title":"Ticket Management"},{"location":"faq.html#portfolio-and-catalog-management","text":"Usage How to link staff members (users) to a group?

To rank the documents at the time of the search, Solr generates a score for each document. Thus, the document that has the highest score, is presented first and the others, with lower scores, in sequence. To calculate the document score Solr uses a standard algorithm, where the frequency of the searched term is checked. But, it is possible to change the punctuation with the use of the boosts. Solr's boosters can be used in two moments at the time of indexing or query, and their use in search is more common. Some boosters that may change the calculation of the score at the time of the survey are: term^num: where \"num\" is the importance of the search term, example: incident^2; And the field boosters and dismax and edismax functions can also be used to boost search. At ITSM, no booster is used, so far, only Solr's standard score calculation is used, and at the end of the search the ranking is done by the score and by the number of times the knowledge was voted / liked. Boosters are open for use, but to use them requires a better analysis of the importance of fields and documents added to Solr, by the knowledge base. How to setup the SOLR feature?

In some reports such as \"Report Incidents / Service Requests - Detailed\", both in pdf format and in xls format, the same request may exist more than once, however they are distinct details because it deals with each step of the request, so each time it \"repeats\" is because it changes the task, or the responsible, or the phase, or the situation, or the group solver or the final hour of service. In other reports, such as the \"Report Incidents / Service Requests\", there is no detail of the request according to the activities and therefore the request is not shown more than once. Why is the result 'Empty Report' when generating the reportQuantitativeControlPercentual when selecting in the filter the situation 'in progress' and the 'solver group'? This is not an error, the solver group field is populated only when the request is terminated, this causes to only brings results to situations such as \"Closed\", incompatible with what is being requested / reported in the filters. Will the backup be overwritten or will there be a file for every day? If your routine has a daily backup, a file will be created every day, containing the name and date of the file.

Creating key for use and consumption of Google APIs \u00b6 In order for the use and consumption of the Google APIs to be possible, a Key API must be created. For this, the following steps must be followed: ATTENTION To peform these procedures, you must be logged in with a Google account. Go to the Google Developer Console https://console.developers.google.com ; Click \u201cCreate project\u201d, as shown in the figure below: Figure 3 - Google developer console A window will appear, as shown in the figure below, to inform the data of the new project; Figure 4 - Project creation screen Enter the name of the project and click the Create button to create the project. After creating the project, click APIs and Services. To create the API Key, click APIs and Services > Credentials > Create Credentials > API Key, as shown in the figure below: Figure 5 - API Key creation screen Once this is done, the API key will be displayed: Figure 6 - API Key options screen for creation Choose the men option that best suits you. For more information on which key will answer you, go to https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#generatingdevkeys After the keys are created, the APIs can already be consumed. APIs to be used in the solutions \u00b6 Below are the Google APIs to consider in the solutions: Figure 7 - APIs Directions API : the Google Directions API is consumed through HTTP requests. This API calculates directions between two points informed, the source and the destination, having several other options. For more information about using this API, access: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions . Distance Matrix API : the Google Distance Matrix API allows the retrieval of arrays of distances between two points, that is, returns approximate result as well. The difference for the Google Directions API is that the Distance Matrix does not return such detailed information as the steps to be performed. For more information about using this API, access: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distancematrix . Geocoding API : the Google geocoding API is an API that helps you retrieve geographic positions by sending an extended address as an argument. The consumption of the API is done by HTTP and the results can be obtained in XML or JSON. For more information about using this API, access: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding . Statics Maps API : the Google Static Maps API will be used in cases where interaction will not be required as a map, only view. It is interesting to use since it is lighter, since it is not necessary to download JS resource and images that will not be used. For more information about using this API, access: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps . Google Maps JavaScript API : the use of the API is done through a JS API. For your use, simply link to JS on the page that will use the maps. For more information about using this API, access: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript Activating an API \u00b6 To enable an API for use, proceed as described below: After performing the steps described in the section 'Creating key for use and consumption of Google APIs'; Click APIs and Services > Enable APIs and Services, as shown in the figure below: Figure 8 - Google APIs The API library will be displayed. Select the API you want to enable (the figure below represents an example of API) and click the \"Activate API\" button as indicated in the figure below: Figure 9 - Google APIs activation Once this is done, the API will be enabled for use.

Active MQ : Java message queue service developed and maintained by Apache. Guacamole/GUACD : Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway. It supports standard protocols like VNC, RDP and SSH. Tika : Apache Tika is a toolkit that detects and extracts metadata and text from different types of file formats (such as PPT, XLS and PDF). Warning Not all platform installations require Guacamole, only those that require remote access to the stations are made from CITSmart. The rest of the tools are required in all facilities for proper platform operation.

Create the directories below to be configured in the 3 (three) steps of web installation. For GED: mkdir -p /opt/citsmart/ged For Knowledge Base: mkdir /opt/citsmart/kb For Synonyms: mkdir /opt/citsmart/twinwords For Attachments of Knowledge Base: mkdir /opt/citsmart/attachkb For Upload: mkdir /opt/citsmart/upload Generate certificate SSL Self-Signed \u00b6 For the Wildfly it will be created a self-signed certificate. If you have a certificate, follow the next steps. TIPS The passwords used in this manual are 123456, please, enter one of your preference; The manual certificate files use the suffix abc, please, put in your preference; The default password for cacerts is \"changeit\" and should be used to add the cer file; If you use different passwords and file names, change before executing the commands.

This document explains the steps in configuring this method. To learn more about Okta, visit okta.com . Before getting started \u00b6 The configuration of this solution is a multi-phase process. The first step is the creation of an Okta account. Procedure \u00b6 1 st Step: Create an Okta account: Access the site: https://www.okta.com ; Click on \"Try Okta\" and then on \"Sign up today\"; Enter the essential data (e-mail, name and last name); Click on \"Get Started\" to complete the operation. Then check the registered e-mail (which will send an access link), access the account with the temporary password sent and change it for greater data security; 2 nd Step: Created CITSmart application within Okta: After completing the previous step, connect to Okta with your newly created account; Click on the \"Applications\" tab and then on \"Add Application\"; Click on \"Create New App\"; Select the option \"SAML 2.0\" and then click on \"Create\"; In the field \"App name\", add the name of the application and soon after, it is necessary to click on \"Next\"; Configure the application path and then click on Next ATTENTION In the \"Single sign on URL\" and \"Audience URI (SP Entity ID)\" field, the URL addresses on which the CITSmart Application will be executed should be included. Select the options \"I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app\" and \"This is an internal app that we have created\". Then, click on \"Finish\". 3 rd Step: Assign users to Okta's CITSmart application: After completing the previous step, you need to click on the \"Applications > Applications\" tab and then on \"Assign Applications\" and choose the filter called \"People\"; Then you can choose the user who will be allowed to access the application that is being created. Click on \"Assign\" and then, to finish, click on \"Done\"; 4 th Step: Include required information in the CITSmart configured on Okta: You will need to configure some data in the WildFly directory. Access the directory, open the \"/standalone/configuration\" folder and change the file \"citsmart.cfg\". Accessed the file, you need to include this information in the file \"citsmart.cfg\": a) In the line SAML2_HOST and SAML2_PORT include the address and port of the CITSmart application; b) In the line SAML2_METADATA include the SAML metadata of the Okta. This data can be obtained by following the instructions below: - Access the CITSmart application in Okta, click the \"Applications > Applications\" tab and then on \"Sign On\". When you click on the \"Identity Provider metadata\" option, a new tab will be available to the metadata, copy the URL of the browser and insert in the property *SAML2_METADATA*; ![Sign On](images/okta.img12.png) c) In the line OKTA_URL , include the main URL in the Okta account. d) In the line OKTA_TOKEN , include the token to access through API. To get this token, follow these steps: Access the CITSmart application in Okta, select the \"Security > API\" menu and then click on \"Create Token\". Name the token and click on \"Create Token\". It will be presented the token value to be copied on the line quoted above. e) In the line OKTA_DOMAIN_ALIAS , include the domain of users coming from Okta. 5 th Step: Synchronize Okta user on CITSmart: Within CITSmart, access the \"Okta Config\" menu and register a new configuration by clicking on \"New\"; Complete the fields with the necessary information: Description : introduce a definition of this new setting Okta; Alias : include the user domain that will be saved to the database. Example: okta\\ administrador@citsmart.com ; URL domain : should include the same value (URL) that was entered in the line OKTA_URL in the \"citsmart.cfg\" file; Token API : include the same value of the token inserted in the line OKTA_TOKEN in the file \"citsmart.cfg\"; Group : insert the ID of the group in which the synchronized and registered user will belong in CITSmart; Access Profile : insert the profile ID in which the synchronized and registered user will belong in CITSmart; Application ID : include the application ID. This information can be retrieved from the Okta URL, as shown below: Click on \"Save\" and then on \"Synchronize users\" to perform the operation. 6 th Step: Configure the Logout: Since Okta does not have a logout screen, in parameter 377 of CITSmart, we can insert some page address to redirect the user to the end of the session; Set up the logout link also at the address (Admin > Settings > Customization > Sign-Out-Page) , then check the option \"Use the custom sign-out page\". Therefore, enter the URL ( https://localhost:8443/citsmart/saml/logout ) with the appropriate adaptations (host and port), according to the image below: NOTE When logout in CITSmart, do not logout from the Okta, since users may have other applications in the Okta session. In contrast, if you do Okta logout , the user session in CITSmart will be removed. What to do next \u00b6 Once the Okta integration with CITSmart is complete, some CITSmart parameters can be configured to better customize this integration. They are: The parameter 445 (Name of the Administrator group in Okta) allows you to choose the administrator group in the Okta solution. If the user belongs to this chosen group, he/she will have the access profile defined as administrator. If this is not the case, your access profile will be the default profile defined by the parameter 39.

The first step is the creation of an Okta account.","title":"Before getting started"},{"location":"citsmart-platform-8/platform-administration/authentication/okta.html#procedure","text":"1 st Step: Create an Okta account: Access the site: https://www.okta.com ; Click on \"Try Okta\" and then on \"Sign up today\"; Enter the essential data (e-mail, name and last name); Click on \"Get Started\" to complete the operation. Then check the registered e-mail (which will send an access link), access the account with the temporary password sent and change it for greater data security; 2 nd Step: Created CITSmart application within Okta: After completing the previous step, connect to Okta with your newly created account; Click on the \"Applications\" tab and then on \"Add Application\"; Click on \"Create New App\"; Select the option \"SAML 2.0\" and then click on \"Create\"; In the field \"App name\", add the name of the application and soon after, it is necessary to click on \"Next\"; Configure the application path and then click on Next ATTENTION In the \"Single sign on URL\" and \"Audience URI (SP Entity ID)\" field, the URL addresses on which the CITSmart Application will be executed should be included. Select the options \"I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app\" and \"This is an internal app that we have created\". Then, click on \"Finish\". 3 rd Step: Assign users to Okta's CITSmart application: After completing the previous step, you need to click on the \"Applications > Applications\" tab and then on \"Assign Applications\" and choose the filter called \"People\"; Then you can choose the user who will be allowed to access the application that is being created. Click on \"Assign\" and then, to finish, click on \"Done\"; 4 th Step: Include required information in the CITSmart configured on Okta: You will need to configure some data in the WildFly directory. Access the directory, open the \"/standalone/configuration\" folder and change the file \"citsmart.cfg\". Accessed the file, you need to include this information in the file \"citsmart.cfg\": a) In the line SAML2_HOST and SAML2_PORT include the address and port of the CITSmart application; b) In the line SAML2_METADATA include the SAML metadata of the Okta. This data can be obtained by following the instructions below: - Access the CITSmart application in Okta, click the \"Applications > Applications\" tab and then on \"Sign On\". When you click on the \"Identity Provider metadata\" option, a new tab will be available to the metadata, copy the URL of the browser and insert in the property *SAML2_METADATA*; ![Sign On](images/okta.img12.png) c) In the line OKTA_URL , include the main URL in the Okta account. d) In the line OKTA_TOKEN , include the token to access through API. To get this token, follow these steps: Access the CITSmart application in Okta, select the \"Security > API\" menu and then click on \"Create Token\". Name the token and click on \"Create Token\". It will be presented the token value to be copied on the line quoted above. e) In the line OKTA_DOMAIN_ALIAS , include the domain of users coming from Okta. 5 th Step: Synchronize Okta user on CITSmart: Within CITSmart, access the \"Okta Config\" menu and register a new configuration by clicking on \"New\"; Complete the fields with the necessary information: Description : introduce a definition of this new setting Okta; Alias : include the user domain that will be saved to the database. Example: okta\\ administrador@citsmart.com ; URL domain : should include the same value (URL) that was entered in the line OKTA_URL in the \"citsmart.cfg\" file; Token API : include the same value of the token inserted in the line OKTA_TOKEN in the file \"citsmart.cfg\"; Group : insert the ID of the group in which the synchronized and registered user will belong in CITSmart; Access Profile : insert the profile ID in which the synchronized and registered user will belong in CITSmart; Application ID : include the application ID. This information can be retrieved from the Okta URL, as shown below: Click on \"Save\" and then on \"Synchronize users\" to perform the operation. 6 th Step: Configure the Logout: Since Okta does not have a logout screen, in parameter 377 of CITSmart, we can insert some page address to redirect the user to the end of the session; Set up the logout link also at the address (Admin > Settings > Customization > Sign-Out-Page) , then check the option \"Use the custom sign-out page\". Therefore, enter the URL ( https://localhost:8443/citsmart/saml/logout ) with the appropriate adaptations (host and port), according to the image below: NOTE When logout in CITSmart, do not logout from the Okta, since users may have other applications in the Okta session. In contrast, if you do Okta logout , the user session in CITSmart will be removed.","title":"Procedure"},{"location":"citsmart-platform-8/platform-administration/authentication/okta.html#what-to-do-next","text":"Once the Okta integration with CITSmart is complete, some CITSmart parameters can be configured to better customize this integration. They are: The parameter 445 (Name of the Administrator group in Okta) allows you to choose the administrator group in the Okta solution. If the user belongs to this chosen group, he/she will have the access profile defined as administrator. If this is not the case, your access profile will be the default profile defined by the parameter 39.

Some changes were made to the audit (itsm-audit-0.4.0), changes that are only at the configuration level. Before getting started \u00b6 Configure the functionality \"Audit\" in your instance. Procedure \u00b6 Process to configure the Audit Configuration to create a backup of the audits. First, it's essential to configure the specific parameters of the functionality. Access the main menu Parametrization > Audit Parametrization; Inform in the field \"Directory\" the folder where it'll be kept all logs of the audits made; In the \"Frequency in days\" field, it's possible to adjust a backup routine of the audit logs, by choosing the periodicity of the backup in days. NOTE The choice of frequency should be from 1 (one) day to the execution of the backup. The possibility of determining a specific period (start and end date) for the generation of system audit logs is made available. IMPORTANT It's offered three types of system audit: audit of system data, system access and system licenses . System data audit It presentes the history of all change, inclusion, and deletion of data in the system. Access the main menu System > Audit trail > System logs; It'll be presented the audit logs of every move performed in the program, showing the date and time of the updates, the IP address, the executor name of the update, the name of the table, the type of operation made in the system. Clicking on the data button, it'll show what was actually updated in the program. NOTE The \"Operations\" field presents the type of action made in the system in thesis. It's defined by symbols, and their meanings are: The letter \"C\" stands for \"Change\" in the system data; The letter \"I\" stands for \"Insertion\" of new data into the system; The letter \"D\" stands for \"Deletion\" of system data. It's also released the search of a log through filters available in the screen. System access audit It presentes the history of access in the system (login and logout).

The creation using the Form menu is 100% manual. If you use the business object menu, you can generate the form from the database. The generated form can be edited in the menu register form. How do I create a menu to access my business process? The creation the menu for business process, is made in the registration of the business process itself by setting the field \"menu\". It is necessary a previously registered menu with two levels, so it can be linked to this process. It is also necessary that after saving the business process with the associated menu, the permissions to the new menu item must be assigned. The assignment of this permission can be accomplished through the menu or the access profile screen. How do I create \"many-to-many\" relationships in the business object? To create a \"many-to-many\" relationship, it is necessary to create a third business object to relate the two objects of the desired business. E.g.: Let's create a many-to-many relationship between two objects, A and B . We will need an object C that will relate with A and B . The object A will have a one-to-many \"relationship\" with the object C , and object B will also have a one-to-many \"relationship\" with the object C . The object C we will need to have two relationships, one of them \"many-to-one,\" with the object A and the other \"many-to-one,\" with the object B . We can relate a data from object A to a lot of data of the object B , and the object B can do the same with object A , through the business object C . I would like to know if every workflow must have a business process? Not every workflow must have or needs a business process. Every Main Workflow needs a business process, however the sub-processes don't require other business processes. In addition, this this rule only applies to process integration flows. The service integration flows do not require a related business process. Is there any alternative to access my workflow tasks opened in a customized menu? I mean, out of task management? You can make your own task list to access the workflow tasks. For a complete tutorial, please check the technical documentation. Is it possible to create customized components that can be used in the forms creation? You can create your own components that will be used in the form. For a complete tutorial, please check the technical documentation. Where should I start building an application using the Neuro? It is recommended that the first step to be executed on the Neuro, is to register the application or register a connection to the DB (database), according to the needs of the application. How does it work the dependency injection in a Neuro form? Which steps must be performed? To inject a dependency , you must register it before. Only CSS and Javascript dependencies types can be injected in a Neuro form. Create a new register according to the dependency type. It can be done via menu \"Neuro > resources\" and upload the dependency. To import it on the form, select the tab \u201cpage type\u201d that you would like to import and choose the tab \"Dependencies\". Click on the \"+ add\" icon to add a new dependency, in the field \"name\" enter the name of your resource dependency and select the corresponding option. For more information about form dependencies, please check the technical documentation. How do I define the actions that should be available in each workflow task? The actions are registered in the main register flow tabs. To associate an action to a specific task, go to the workflow design, open the element properties, and select the desired actions. After all that is done, save your changes. How do I delete an element from the workflow? To delete a workflow element, select the element you want to delete, and then press Ctrl + Del. What do I do when I get this error message \"business process not informed\"? This error occurs because the business process is not referenced in the controller of the form that starts the business process. To fix this problem, access the business process form, and then insert the following command on the controller \"p/process Page\": $scope. businessProcessName = ' name_of_the_business_process'; I would like to know, when I register a sub-process, the information in the main process is inherited by the sub-process? No, it doesn\u00b4t inherit. When you include a new sub-process, BPE or ESI in the main workflow, you must inform the \"attributes\", the exact name of the sub-process that must be created on the workflow registration. All information, such as actions and main workflow status should be replicated in the sub-process registration. In short steps, it is recommended to follow the following order: Register the main workflow; Register the sub-process; Include the element of sub-process, making a reference to the sub-process already created. What is the difference between a process integration workflow and a service integration workflow? The process integration workflow has tasks performed by users, and may also have automated tasks performed by the system. The service integration workflow has workflows that were executed, based on system services, such as integrations and conversions, for example. There is no problem if a process integration workflow uses a sub-process of the service integration workflow.","title":"Neuro FAQ"},{"location":"neuro/neuro-faq.html#neuro-frequently-asked-questions-faq","text":"What is the difference between creating a form using the Form menu and via the Business Object?

These elements are subdivided into: Events: \"They trigger, interrupt, change or terminate the process. These events are classified as start, intermediate or end events, depending on when they occur in the process.\" Tasks: \"It's the smallest part of a process. It is an action, not a function, nor the state of a product or service.

Variables In this tab the selected variables that are part of this task must be selected. Several variables can be selected, which can be for input and / or output. The list presented here is the same as in the \" Variables \" tab of the workflow register. User Actions The user actions tab represents the actions that the user can trigger when executing a task and, depending on the action selected, the flow may follow an alternate flow, it all depends on modeling. The actions that are presented in this list are the same ones that were registered in the \"Actions\" tab of the workflow register. Interface This tab defines how the graphical user interface will be shown when performing this task, that is, how it will be the screen that the user it will operate.

The name of the dependency and the path in which it is located must be entered. The user must also inform whether it will be injected into the controller. Figure 6 - Dependencies Design the screen, to create the screen designing, click Edit Screen or navigate to the system tab Screen Designing that opens automatically: Drag the components located on the left side palette to the center of the screen according to the shape you want to build the form. The components are arranged in rows and columns, and the rows have a width of 12 columns. This means that in each line you can insert up to 2 components with width 6, or up to 3 components with width 4, for example. It is not mandatory to fill the entire row; You can also create tabs on the forms. To do this, go to the tabs menu, and choose tabs horizontally or vertically. The tabs will be added on the screen, and you can design the screen with the components on each tab. Figure 7 - Design Click \"Save\" to run the changes. You can save it in the original version (current version), or in a new version. JS for visualization This tab has the ability to add variables in the JavaScript scope on the screen that opens when you click the \"View Screen\" button.
